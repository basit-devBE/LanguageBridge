echo "Step 1: User makes API call"
echo "  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/translate/text"

echo -e "\nStep 2: Your API uploads to S3"
echo "  → File: s3://ai-and-automation/requests/abc123_timestamp.json"
echo "  → Content: {\"text\": \"Hello\", \"target_language\": \"es\"}"

echo -e "\nStep 3: S3 Event Trigger (Created by Terraform)"
echo "  → S3 detects new file in requests/ folder"
echo "  → Automatically invokes Lambda function"

echo -e "\nStep 4: Lambda Processing (Created by Terraform)"
echo "  → Downloads request file from S3"
echo "  → Calls AWS Translate: 'Hello' → 'Hola'"
echo "  → Uploads result to s3://ai-and-automation/responses/"

echo -e "\nStep 5: User checks status"
echo "  curl http://localhost:3000/api/translate/status/abc123"
echo "  → Your API finds result in S3 responses/ folder"
echo "  → Returns: {\"translated_text\": \"Hola\"}"

echo -e "\n${BLUE}🏗️ WHAT TERRAFORM CREATES:${NC}\n"

echo "✅ Lambda Function: ai-automation-translation-handler"
echo "✅ IAM Role: Permissions for S3, Translate, CloudWatch"
echo "✅ S3 Event Trigger: Auto-invokes Lambda on file upload"
echo "✅ Lambda Permissions: Allows S3 to trigger the function"

echo "1. Deploy Terraform:"
echo "   cd infrastructure && terraform apply"

echo -e "\n2. Test complete workflow:"
echo "   ./test_api.sh"

echo -e "\n3. Monitor the process:"
echo "   aws s3 ls s3://ai-and-automation/requests/"
echo "   aws s3 ls s3://ai-and-automation/responses/"
echo "   aws logs tail /aws/lambda/ai-automation-translation-handler"

echo -e "\n${YELLOW}🎯 THE KEY INSIGHT:${NC}"
echo "Your API is already 90% complete!"
echo "Terraform just adds the automated processing layer"
echo "that makes translations actually happen in the background."

echo -e "\n${GREEN}Ready to deploy? Run: ./deploy.sh${NC}"
